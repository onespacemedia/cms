Onespacemedia CMS Documentation
===============================

A collection of Django extensions that add content-management facilities to Django projects, originally forked from `etianen/cms <https://github.com/etianen/cms>`_. The team at `Onespacemedia <http://www.onespacemedia.com>`_ are actively working on the project, adding new features, updating existing ones and keeping it working with the latest versions of Django.

The current version of onespacemedia-cms should always be compatible with the current version of Django.

.. note:: A lot of the CMS has settings specific to how `Onespacemedia <http://www.onespacemedia.com>`_ works and as such you will likely to need to change some of them to suit your needs. In addition, this project installs a lot of other packages which you may not need. You may prefer to use the `original repository <https://github.com/etianen/cms>`_ instead of this one.
