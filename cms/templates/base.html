This is a placeholder main page for your site's pages.
To overwite this globally, add a file called "base.html" to your root "templates" directory.

If you want to override this on a per-app basis, assuming an app called "example_app", simply add a file called "base.html" to your "templates/example_app" folder.
If you're adding a template for a model, for example called "Content" in the "example_app" app, just add a template called "content.html" to your "templates/example_app" folder.
