# Changelog

## Next release
* Django 2.2 compatibility is now complete:
  * **Breaking change:** If you are using `LocalisationMiddleware`, change your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` setting to `MIDDLEWARE`. The other CMS middleware is now compatible with both, but the check for localisation middleware now only looks at `MIDDLEWARE`, to simplify 2.2 compatibility.
  * **Breaking change:** `cms` must now be in your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
  * **Breaking change:** localised sites now use `geoip2` - you will need to [update your GeoIP database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases).
  * All `ForeignKey`s now have an `on_delete` explicitly specified (one was missed in 4.2.0).

## 4.3.1 - 2019-12-04
* The [documentation](https://onespacemedia.github.io/cms/) has been completely rewritten.

## 4.3.0 - 2019-11-12
* Importing `cms.sitemaps` at the top level of a module containing an app's AppConfig no longer raises `AppRegistryNotReady`.
* `PageBase`'s help text for the `slug` field now makes sense.
* `OnlineBase` and its derivatives (including the Page model) now implement `get_preview_url()`, to generate a URL at which non-admin users can preview an object.
* Remove a pessimisation in `PageManager.get_homepage`.

## 4.2.0 - 2019-11-06

* Show usage of media library files on the file's change form.
* Make middleware compatible with both `MIDDLEWARE` and `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`.
* Ensure all `ForeignKey`s have an `on_delete` explicitly specified for Django 2.2 compatibility.
